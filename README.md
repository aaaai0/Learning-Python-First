# Learning Python First

I learned the basics of Python quite a long time ago, but I started using Github quite recently, so I ask you to report it if something is wrong. 

I also want to say that my words may appear incorrectly or distorted here and in file comments, since I am not strong in English, at the moment I use Google Translater
